üêö ShellHop
===========

**A Single-Hop SSH Relay Network Designed to Circumvent Censorship and Access Controls.**

ShellHop is a minimal, peer-assisted SSH tunneling system that helps users access restricted services---such as IRC bridges---by routing connections through trusted, volunteer-run relay nodes. These relays forward SSH traffic to a gateway under your control, which injects **PROXY protocol headers** to preserve the user's original IP without exposing internal services directly.

üîê Features
-----------

-   üîÅ **Single-hop architecture** for simplicity and speed

-   üõ∞Ô∏è **Peer-based relays** with client reachability checks
  - This is currently a work-in-process. At this time the relay and gateway ips are hard coded for testing.

-   üõ°Ô∏è **Relay Authentication** using HMAC (challenge-response)

-   üß† **Resilient** against filtering, blocking, and censorship

-   üíª **User-friendly** with embedded SSH client logic

ShellHop is purpose-built for projects like [**transirc.chat**](https://transirc.chat), where users need **censorship-resistant**, **privacy-preserving**, and **reliable** access to community services---even from hostile networks.

üß™ Key Generation and Relay Obfuscation
---------------------------------------

ShellHop uses **HMAC** for authenticating relays to the gateway. Only relays with a shared secret key can forward traffic. The key is never transmitted --- instead, relays respond to challenges using HMAC signatures. The secret is **obfuscated** into the compiled relay binary.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Steps
---------------

### 1\. üóùÔ∏è Generate a Gateway Key

On the **gateway server**:

```
cd gateway
./shellhop-gateway --keygen my_relay_key

```

This will:

-   Generate a **256-bit random key**.

-   Save it to `keys/my_relay_key.key`.

‚úÖ You can create multiple keys---one per relay---for easier revocation.

* * * * *

### 2\. üöö Transfer and Obfuscate the Key on the Relay

1.  **Securely copy** the key file to the relay:

    ```
    scp gateway/keys/my_relay_key.key user@relay:/path/to/relay/

    ```

2.  On the **relay server**:

```
cd relay
go run prepare_key.go my_relay_key.key

```

This:

-   Reads the key file.

-   Applies an **XOR obfuscation**.

-   Outputs a `relay_key.go` file with the obfuscated key and runtime logic to decode it.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** commit `relay_key.go` if you're concerned about secret leakage. It embeds the secret in obfuscated but recoverable form.

* * * * *

### 3\. üèóÔ∏è Build the Relay Binary

```
go build -o shellhop-relay

```

The resulting binary includes the embedded key and is ready to connect to your gateway.

‚úÖ Summary
---------

| Component   | Description |
|-------------| --- |
| **Gateway** | Accepts relay connections, verifies HMAC auth, injects PROXY headers |
| **Relay**   | Connects to gateway, authenticates via HMAC, forwards SSH traffic |
| **client**  | Connects via SSH to a relay, which tunnels traffic to the gateway |
